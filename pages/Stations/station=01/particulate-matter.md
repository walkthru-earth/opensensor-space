The particulate matter dashboard is under development and will be available soon.

Data from the PMS5003 sensor is being collected starting from April 4, 2025, but the visualizations are still being prepared.

Check back later for detailed analysis of:
  - PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 concentration measurements
  - Particle count data by size
  - Air quality index calculations
